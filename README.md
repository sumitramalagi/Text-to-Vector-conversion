# Text-to-Vector-conversion
Implementation of methods used to convert text to vector. I have used Amazon fine foods review dataset obtained from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews) and sklearn to convert reviews to vector using following methods:
1.Bag of Words
2.TF-IDF
3.Average Word2Vec
4. TF-IDF Weighted Word2Vec

The models are fit using training data and transform is applied on the whole dataset. Word2Vec is trained using reviews data.
